       "quote":"<p>Intercession is the spiritual engine of our lives that enables God to do what He, in most cases, will not do without it. Our intercession bridges the gap between heaven and earth to allow the manifestation of God Kingdom in our present time. The Lord calls us to the place of intercession continually. It is not something He turns off and on. (Romans 8:34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes, who is risen, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us).
It is a matter of tapping into the reality that Jesus is continually engaged in this intercession for His people. He ever lives to intercede for us, the saints. If we want to get close to the heart of God then we have to embrace a life of intercession. <strong>The life of intercession is for every saint.</strong> To live outside this realm of God reality is to live short of your calling. Intercession is foundational for our lives, just as it is foundation to be a person of the Word of God or to live a life of worship. It is the life of prayer that is continually connected to the heart of God and His purposes in effect to see the will of God done in the earth. To be a person of the Holy Spirit our lives should be given to intercession. The Spirit knows how to intercede and intervene to bring His desires to pass.</p><br>
