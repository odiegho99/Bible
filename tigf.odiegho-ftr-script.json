       "quote":"Lifting you before the throne with love and gentle pleas, asking God to give you strength to face another day and when the night is darkest, shine light upon your way, somewhere someone kneeling to whisper your name in prayer, knowing that you need to feel God love and tender care, intercede on your behalf, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior. Knowing that you have a need, from the Father Almighty, praying for you when you are not able to say a single word, how great it is, knowing the prayer will be heard. Laying you at the alter, kneeling there at God feet, giving all cares to Him, there at the mercy seat, our God is always listening to every earnest prayer, when we look to Him for help, the answer is always there. It such a comfort to know that someone pray for you, place you within God loving hands, those prayers will see you through, as we kneel before the Father Almighty, thanking Him for your life and for those who cares and pray for your success and when we bow before the mercy seat, we whisper your names to God in prayers.","author":""}
