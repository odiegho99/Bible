       "quote":"Given the very nature and charater of God. II Pt. 1:4. Our spirits have been re-created in His image and all the spiritual forces found in Him have been imparted in us, His love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance, all says in Gal. 5:22-23. Having His wisdom, having the same anointing available for our minds, that He had when He was here on earth. So divine that all perfect gift without us are not complete. We don't need to ask God for those things, they are already in us, we just have to cultivate and develop them. If all we have was the life of Jesus working in us on our own behalf, that alone would be enough to make us forever grateful, but amazing enough, that is not all we have been given. God also divinely equipped us with another mighty element. He is given us the power to meet the needs of other people like JESUS did. This persuation and determination connects us not only with God's divine life and nature but with the very ministry of JESUS. Yes, we are determined because of the divinely designed to operate in the gift of the spirit, so nothing will stop us. Right in the midst of all of the daily demands of life, we will rise in faith, hope and love and beging to do what God divinely designed for us.","author":""}
