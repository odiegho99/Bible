       "quote":"<h1>Christ for all</h1><br>
    <p>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  (Romans 8:34).  “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them”.(Hebrew 7:25).</p>
<p>Intercession is the greatest, and most powerful ministry on earth, most wanted and sought out for by God.
Intercession is the highest ministry of the Church. This was the ministry of our Lord Jesus when He was here on earth and even right now on the throne, He Intercedes day and night for the needs of the Church. One of such Intercessions is for the evangelization of the world.</p>
<p>Since the birth of the Church in Jerusalem over 2000 years ago, Jesus has been calling the Church into this special ministry of intercession as evident in the above scripture.
The first set are believers who pray generally for a period of time, as the spirit leads. They might be called into the office of an Intercessor, but most christians operate on the general believers’ mandate to Intercede for their churches, pastors, spiritual, political leaders, un-saved people, nations, etc.</p>
 <p>In obedience to the commands of God to all believers in Christ as seen in 1 Timothy 2:1-3, “I exhort therefore that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men; for Kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour”.
 This is one of the greatest commands that must be obeyed by all Christians and church leaders. When you obey this command you will have a part in the highest form of Christian service on earth.</p><br><br>
    <h1>Christ Like</h1>
    <p>Given the very nature and charater of God. II Pt. 1:4. Our spirits have been re-created in His image and all the spiritual forces found in Him have been imparted in us, His love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance, all says in Gal. 5:22-23. Having His wisdom, having the same anointing available for our minds, that He had when He was here on earth. So divine that all perfect gift without us are not complete. We don't need to ask God for those things, they are already in us, we just have to cultivate and develop them. If all we have was the life of Jesus working in us on our own behalf, that alone would be enough to make us forever grateful, but amazing enough, that is not all we have been given. God also divinely equipped us with another mighty element. He is given us the power to meet the needs of other people like JESUS did. This persuation and determination connects us not only with God's divine life and nature but with the very ministry of JESUS. Yes, we are determined because of the divinely designed to operate in the gift of the spirit, so nothing will stop us. Right  in the midst of all of the daily demands of life, we will rise in faith, hope and love and beging to do what God divinely designed for us.</p><hr><br>
    <h1>Intercession</h1>
    <p><strong>Intercession is the spiritual engine of our lives that enables God to do what He, in most cases, will not do without it.</strong> Our intercession bridges the gap between heaven and earth to allow the manifestation of God Kingdom in our present time. The Lord calls us to the place of intercession continually. It is not something He turns off and on. (Romans 8:34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes, who is risen, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us).
It is a matter of tapping into the reality that Jesus is continually engaged in this intercession for His people. He ever lives to intercede for us, the saints. If we want to get close to the heart of God then we have to embrace a life of intercession. <strong>The life of intercession is for every saint.</strong> To live outside this realm of God reality is to live short of your calling. Intercession is foundational for our lives, just as it is foundation to be a person of the Word of God or to live a life of worship. It is the life of prayer that is continually connected to the heart of God and His purposes in effect to see the will of God done in the earth. To be a person of the Holy Spirit our lives should be given to intercession. The Spirit knows how to intercede and intervene to bring His desires to pass.</p><br>
    <h1>The Dual Effect of Intercession</h1>
    <p>Romans 8:26-27 Likewise, the Spirit helps us in our weaknesses, for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
    <p><strong>We see in this verse that the Holy Spirit wants to even bridge the gap in our own lives.</strong> He knows our weaknesses. This is not only weakness in not knowing what to pray for others but for knowing how to pray for ourselves. He is the Helper that wants to help us. Have you needed any help lately? Get in connection with the Holy Spirit through a life of intercession. Through intercession we reap what we sow. As we allow the Holy Spirit to pray through us He begins filling in the gaps of our own lives as well as the lives of others around us. There is a dual-effect in our intercession where we instantly reap of the benefits of a life given over to prayer.</p>","author":"Zig Ziglar"}
